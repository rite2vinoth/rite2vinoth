Hi

I am Vinoth Mohanram. I used to be a financial services programme manager / leader in the past life, now a Data Scientist by study. 
I recently completed my Master's degree in Data Science from Birkbeck, University of London.

I am interested to solve real life problems leveraging the power of data and algorithms. My master's thesis is the usage of Deep Learning for Non intrusive load monitoring systems.
I am also a raspberry pi tinkering hobbyist and my most recent project is a fish feeder for my pet gold fish which can be controlled over the internet and it also live streams. 

Check out my other projects in the repositories.
